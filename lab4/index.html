			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was to start writing pseudocode for various tasks to prepare for coding.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didnt have any problems with this lab, everything was fairly straight forward.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This lab made me excited to start coding and designing for our project soon!</p>

					<h3>Pseudocode of Baking Focaccia</h3>
					<li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
					<ul><li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, olive oil, and yeast.</li>
					<li>Stir until the dough turns sticky.</li></ul>
					<li>First Rise:</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Put your dough in a lightly (olive) oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a towel.</li>
					<li>Let it rise in a warm area for about 1-2 hours.</li></ul>
					<li>Shape the Focaccia:</li><ul>
					<li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees.</li>
					<li>Drizzle a 9x13 baking pan with some olive oil.</li>
					<li>Gently deflate the dough and transfer it to the prepared 9x13.</li>
					<li>Press and stretch the dough to fill the pan, creating dimples with your fingers.</li></ul>
					<li>Second Rise:</li><ul>
					<li>Cover your dough with plastic wrap or a towel.</li>
					<li>Let it rise for about 20 minutes while the oven is heating.</li></ul>
					<li>Toppings:</li><ul>
					<li>Brush the top of the focaccia with more olive oil.</li>
					<li>Add your choice of toppings, such as rosemary, thyme, olives, cherry tomatoes, onions, garlic, and sea salt.</li></ul>
					<li>Bake:</li><ul>
					<li>Put your focaccia in the oven and bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.</li></ul>
					</ul>

				<h3>Pseudocode for Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
				<pre><code>
	// Have each player their three choices (rock, paper, or scissors)
		// Player 1 selects their input from the 3 choices
		// Player 2 selects their input from the 3 choices
	// Both inputs are compared, and a winner is chosen
	// The winning player’s score increases by 1
		// Retrive winning player’s score
		// Add 1 to winning player’s score
	// The updated score count for both players is shown
	// Game resets
		// (Restarts from the beginning)

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				I encountered no major problems while working on this lab, but ran into some formatting issues. I realized that my divs we're not properly nested, and that I had to move some of my divs around to get the desired effect. I also had to change some to spans to avoid line breaks.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="minor-section" id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			Enter your name to see what my APIs think about you!<br>
			<input id="name" type="text" autocomplete="given-name" placeholder="John">
			<button id="activate">Profile Me!</button>
			<div id="output" hidden>
				Based on just your name, my APIs (probably incorrectly) tell me that:<br>
				Your name sounds like its from <span id="nat"></span>!<br>
				Also sounds like you are possibly a <span id="gen"></span>, but who really knows....<br>
				And about <span id="age"></span> years old!<hr>
				Also your IP address is: <span id="ip"></span>, and you're using <span id="os"></span> on <span id="browser"></span> near <span id="loc"></span><br>
				... sorry had to check.
